# Dong admin
Dong admin is an FE admin script made by bIue#2958

## Usage
### Arguments
For basic admin, you can only use a target as a singular target.
Head admin features the "all" target, which uses the command on every single player excluding yourself  

### Main features
The prefix is ``;`` currently, but I am going to find out how to make it configurable via commands.
The problem with that is because of how roblox uses key codes and enumerations (ex. Enum.Keycode.Semicolon)  

### Loader
For basic admin, use this script: ``loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lolz59/dong/main/basic.lua", true))``  
The loader for Premium admin will be sent to you when purchased, most likely via an email.  

## Basic admin
This is the free version. You can get it in the file called ``basic.lua``  
Basic commands are limited because it is free, you can compare it in ``cmds.lua``

## Head admin  
Head admin is the paid version, but its not for sale yet.
